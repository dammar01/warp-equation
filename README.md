# Warp Equation

This Python application implements the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel method for solving a system of linear equations. The method is iterative and useful for solving large systems where direct methods like Gaussian elimination may not be efficient. The solver also tracks iteration data, including the error and convergence status at each step.

Note: This project is intended solely for educational purposes. It should be used as a learning tool to understand the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel method and numerical solving techniques. It is not optimized for production environments or real-world large-scale applications.
